# ADAL-.NET-Console-Application
This is an ADAL .net Console application that will get 5 users from the Microsoft Graph in a test tenant.

The creation of this Application is explained in the AAD Dev Support blogs : https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/aaddevsup/2018/11/07/how-to-use-the-adal-net-library-to-call-the-microsoft-graph-api-in-a-console-application-using-authorization-code-flow/

This will get an access token using ADAL V4.3 and then get 5 users from the Microsoft Graph API 

In addition to that, if you're interested in the Microsoft Graph SDK, feel free to follow this blog post to learn how to do that to extend off of this github repo:
